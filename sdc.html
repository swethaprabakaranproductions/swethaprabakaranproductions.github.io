<li><strong>March:</strong></li>
<li>while we’re in the devising process, we would meet max 1-2 times a week. Times/days can potentially be flexible based on what works best for the core team.</li>
<li>Hoping to start ASAP, even if it’s quick 30 minute zooms wherever we can all find time</li>
<li><strong>April and 1st half of May:</strong></li>
<li>lower musician time commitment once show is roughly devised and scored</li>
<li>Expect 1 practice/meeting once every 2 weeks or maybe 3 weeks. Would be mostly used for check-ins and “cleanup”</li>

  <li><strong>2nd half of May and June:</strong></li>
  <li>1 rehearsal per week minimum with dancers & musicians; used for full runthroughs leading to show day. Max 2 rehearsals/week, if necessary</li>
  <li>Currently planned for 1 weeknight and 1 weekend session each week, 2-3 hours each time. We’ll determine once we get closer which practices need to be dancers-only vs full company.</li>
