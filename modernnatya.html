<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tentative Show &nbsp;Information:</strong></span></h3>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Musicians - Rehearsals and Prep Time Commitment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We rehearse on zoom and in-person in SF.&nbsp;All of our in-person rehearsals continue to take diligent COVID-precautions to protect immunocompromised teammates.</li>
<li>In-person rehearsals will be held at PUSH dance company in downtown San Francisco (447 Minna St; near Powell BART station)</li>
<li><strong>March:</strong></li>
<li>while we’re in the devising process, we would meet max 1-2 times a week. Times/days can potentially be flexible based on what works best for the core team.</li>
<li>Hoping to start ASAP, even if it’s quick 30 minute zooms wherever we can all find time</li>
<li><strong>April and 1st half of May:</strong></li>
<li>lower musician time commitment once show is roughly devised and scored</li>
<li>Expect 1 practice/meeting once every 2 weeks or maybe 3 weeks. Would be mostly used for check-ins and “cleanup”</li>
<li>We’re also hoping to schedule a studio  session to record a high-fidelity version of the music before show day</li>
<li><strong>2nd half of May and June:</strong></li>
<li>1 rehearsal per week minimum with dancers & musicians; used for full runthroughs leading to show day. Max 2 rehearsals/week, if necessary</li>
<li>Currently planned for Mondays 7-10pm and 1 weekend session (exact time TBD). We’ll determine once we get closer which practices need to be dancers-only vs full company.</li>
</ul>
